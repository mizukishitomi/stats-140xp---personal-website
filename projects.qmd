# (1) Monopoly 

Developed a statistical model to estimate the likelihood of a player landing on each space in the popular board game Monopoly, providing insights for strategic gameplay. Here is my [Monopoly project](/projects/project1.qmd).

# (2) Knot Theory Research 

Researched on the Knot theory, a sub-field of Topology that deals with the study of
mathematical knots. Here is my [research poster](projects/DRP_Poster.pdf).
